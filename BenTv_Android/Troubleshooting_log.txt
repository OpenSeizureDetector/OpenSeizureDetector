      vlc rtsp://guest:guest@192.168.1.25/12

VLC reports codec information as

    Stream 1 (Audio)
    	   Codec: PCM ALAW (alaw)
	   Channels: Mono
	   Sample Rate: 8000 Hz
	   Bits per sample: 16

Android

I think the 701 warning is a temprorary pause to buffer data, so does not sond worrying on start-up.
Unfortunately the Error means an Unspecified Media Player error, which is not helpful!!!

Change some things to see if we can narrow down the problem
===========================================================
* Check if it is an audio or video problem causing the error - disable audio on camera.
  VLC still reports the audio stream as existing, but no mention of channels, and only 8 bits per sample (rather than 16).
  Android gave same errors as initial case.

* Try different Audio Codec - change to G.726 codec and enable audio.
  VLC reports audio codec as G.726 APCM Audio (g726).
  Android gave same errors as initial case.

  So maybe it is not the audio causing the trouble - android should support PCM (but maybe not g726 APCM?) (http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/media-formats.html).
